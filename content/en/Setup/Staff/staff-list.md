## **Overview**

When you want to create staff within a certain legal entity, you need to use the staff list section. While creating the staff list, there must be workers registered in the system. Workers must first be created from the Human Resource-Workers section. Because when we click on 'Create Worker' on the staff list screen, a list appears on the screen. This list shows all workers hired by the company along with their staff member numbers. In this way, the workers selected from the list are associated with the professions in the staff type field (physician, nurse, etc.) and the assignment of the worker within a certain legal entity is completed.

This staff member created in the staff list can be an active user of the program. So, a user name can be created for this person through the IT Department. In this case, it is necessary to associate the user with the worker. In this way, the transactions that the worker can manage in the program are specified according to the selected staff type. In fact, each of the assigned workers may not need to be a user. For example, an Anesthesia assistant may not need to make a transaction on MedAX. However, in order for the assistant to be assigned in any surgery and to be assigned other duties, he/she must be created in the staff list as a human resource.
