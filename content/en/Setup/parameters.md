## About

In this section, you can see the licenses that are used for user, hospital clinic and practice. For example, in the users row, count is equal to 150 and expire date is 31.12.2022. That means the number of user created by Admin could be 150 at most until 31.12.2022.

## Number Sequences

You need to determine reference numbers to create well-organized lists and tables. Firstly, you should specify the format of the number. The formatting part can be done with the help of the **Organization Administration â€“ Number Sequences** section. So, the created format can be matched with the desired number type in the **MedAX-Setup-Parameters-Number Sequences** section.
