## Overview

The fees for the services provided in a hospital or a clinic are determined by the company. Discounts may be applied to these prices for different reasons. Sales and marketing policies, economic conditions, personnel discounts, campaigns or private customers could be displayed as a discount reason. You can use the reasons among them in MedAX. In order for such discounts to be operated in MedAX in a healthy way,

1. You need to create your discount reasons in **Discount** section.
2. You need to create your personnel groups that can apply these discounts in **Discount Definitions** section.
3. You need to determine detailed discount rates for each group you create in **Discount Definitions** section.
4. You must place your personnel, who can apply for a discount, in an appropriate personnel group in **Staff-Staff List** section.
   
In this way, you will have implemented a flexible and effective discount policy within your company.
