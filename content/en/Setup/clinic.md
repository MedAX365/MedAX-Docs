### Specifying the health services for each department


You can define departments in the **Setup-Department** session. For each department and for each facility, you can specify what type of health service is provided in which facility you select on behalf of the department determined. In this way, you can also determine the admission types in front office.  For example, cardiology department exists in a certain facility. Once you select department as cardiology and the facility, you can specify the services provided in the department such as outpatient, inpatient or procedure by clicking 'Yes'.

### Assigning medical form to each department


After you determine the available services in the departments, you can also assign medical forms for each department or hospital. You can reach the brief explanations about medical form in **Setup-Medical Form-Medical Form Design**.

With the help of 'Medical Form Design', the medical forms can be created. So you can assign the forms to departments and hospitals accordingly. When you create the new form, you can determine the medical form by populating the 'Medical Form Entity' field. You can also create an effective date which is the starting date of that the form is used.

### Visit Label

During patient admission, labels containing the patient's data are printed. In this field, the visit label design type can be selected for each department.
