# Examination Module ‚Äì Active Examinations

## Overview
The **Active Examinations** page allows physicians to manage patients who are currently undergoing a consultation. From here, the doctor can search for active visits, open a patient‚Äôs examination record, and record clinical details such as complaints, medical history, diagnoses, allergies, and progress notes. On this page date is today's day as a default. The doctor can change the date date and can find examination requests for the date. If the doctor deletes the date, he/she can see all the requests 

This page is the starting point for examining patients properly and ensuring their medical record is kept complete and up-to-date.
