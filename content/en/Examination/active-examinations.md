# Issuing Sick Notes (Medical Report)

## 1. Purpose  
This document describes the steps to generate and issue a Sick Note (Medical Report) for patients in MedAX.  

## 2. Definition  
A **Sick Note (Medical Report)** is an official document provided by a physician to confirm a patient’s illness and recommend rest or exemption from work/school for a specific period.  

## 3. Access Path  
1. Go to **Front Office > Visit List**.  
2. Select the patient visit for which a sick note is required.  
3. Open the visit details and choose **Medical Report > Sick Note**.  

## 4. Data Entry  
When creating a Sick Note, fill in the following information:  
- **Patient Name** (auto-filled from visit record)  
- **Date of Visit** (auto-filled)  
- **Diagnosis / Reason for Sick Note**  
- **Start Date** of rest period  
- **End Date** of rest period  
- **Physician Name** (auto-filled)  
- **Additional Notes** (optional, e.g., “Fit to resume work on …”)  

After entering the required information, click **Generate Report**.  

## 5. Output  
- The system generates a formal Sick Note in PDF or printable format.  
- The document includes patient and physician details, rest period, and diagnosis.  
- The Sick Note is linked to the patient’s medical record for future reference.  

## 6. Example Scenario  
1. Patient: *Nina Frenz*  
2. Visit: `000000049` (Outpatient – General Practice)  
3. Reason: Influenza  
4. Sick Note: 3 days (16/07/2025 – 18/07/2025)  
5. Physician: *Dr. Steve Karagedik*  
6. Output: Printable Sick Note PDF stored in patient’s record.  

## 7. Tips  
- Ensure the **rest period** is compliant with organizational or legal policies.  
- For long-term absence, an extended medical certificate may be required.  
- Once issued, Sick Notes cannot be modified — if correction is needed, a new note must be generated.
